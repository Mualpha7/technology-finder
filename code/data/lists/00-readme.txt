This directory has code and other notes on collecting lists of technologies and
lists of non-technologies.


Lists of technologies and non-technologies are created from: titles from the
corpus of wikepedia files, FUSE annotations, new annotations and any other
sources.


1- Titles of AcousticMinusSensorData, SensorData and TransducersWiki corpora.

This was done with create_lists.py and the results are stored in

    tech-AcousticMinusSensorData.txt
    tech-SensorData.txt
    tech-TrandsducersWiki.txt


2- FUSE annotations.

Not added yet.


3- New annotation on SensorData and the other corpora above.

Unlabeled data can be created with create_annotation.py.

The file labels-SensorData-01000.txt was created from a list of terms ordered on
frequency from the SensorData corpus. The first colum is being labeled with 'y',
'n' or '?' or nothing if we have no clue.


4- Any other source.

Not added yet.
